    <h3>About us:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> <p> MAC Cosmetics, stylized as M·A·C, is a cosmetics manufacturer founded in Toronto in 1984 by Frank Toskan and Frank Angelo. The company is headquartered in New York City and became part of the Estée Lauder Companies in 1998. MAC is an abbreviation for Make-up Art Cosmetics.</p> </li>
      <li><p>During his time as a photographer and makeup artist, co-founder Frank Toskan realized the lack of suitable colours and textures needed to maximize performance and result of makeup for these industries. Further, he realized how limited conventional products in the cosmetic industry were to responding to the needs of the modern woman. For the first time ethnicity in makeup was addressed. Toskan began to craft a niche market in the world of makeup. Family joined forces including brother-in-law and chemist Victor Casale. MAC very quickly cultivated a following in both the fashion and the retail markets. Initially sold exclusively at the BAY in Canada it quickly expanded to Henry Bendel in New York.</p></li>
